1. Compute the average value, the average squared value, and the variance
for a stationary random process with the distribution of a sample:
    * $w_1(x) = \mathcal{U}[a,b]$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$
    * $w_1(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{8} x$. For this one, also plot the
    function and check that its integral really is 1

2. Compute the temporal average value, the temporal average squared value,
the temporal variance, and the temporal autocorrelation function for 
the following realization of a finite-length random process:
$$f = [-1, 2, -1, 2, -1, 2, -1, 2, -1, 2]$$

2. Compute the temporal average value, the temporal average squared value,
the temporal variance, and the temporal autocorrelation function for 
the following deterministic signal:
$$ s(t) = cos(2 \pi f t)$$

	(Hint: Consider $s(t)$ to be a realization of a random process, and proceed as usual).
