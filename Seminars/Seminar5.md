1. A signal can have two values, $-4$ (hypothesis $H_0$) or $5$ (hypothesis $H_1$). 
The signal is affected by AWGN $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2=1)$.
The receiver takes 3 samples with values $\left\{ 1.1, 4.4, 2.2 \right\}$.
    a. What is decision according to Maximum Likelihood criterion? Use all three interpretations.

2. Consider detecting a signal $s(t) = 3 \sin(2 \pi f_1 t)$ that can be present (hypothesis $H_1$) or not (hypothesis $H_0$).
The signal is affected by AWGN $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2=1)$.
The receiver takes 2 samples.
    a. What are the best sample times $t_1$ and $t_2$ to maximize detection performance?
    b. The receiver takes 2 samples with values $\left\{ 1.1, 4.4 \right\}$, at sample times $t_1 = \frac{0.125}{f_1}$ and $t_2 = \frac{0.625}{f_1}$.
    What is decision according to Maximum Likelihood criterion? Use the geometrical interpretation.
    c. What if the receiver takes an extra third sample at time $t_3 = \frac{0.5}{f_1}$. Will the detection be improved?
