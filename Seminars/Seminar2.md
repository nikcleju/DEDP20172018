1. Compute the average value, the average squared value, and the variance
for a stationary random process with the distribution of a sample:
    * $w_1(x) = \mathcal{U}[a,b]$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$
    * $w_1(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{8} x$. For this one, also plot the
    function and check that its integral really is 1
    
2. TBD
