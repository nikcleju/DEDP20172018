1. A signal can have four possible values: -6, -2, 2, 6. Each value
lasts for 1 second. The signal is affected
by white noise with normal distribution. The receiver takes 1 sample per second.
Using ML criterion, decide what signal has been transmitted, if the received samples are:
$$4, 6.6, -5.2, 1.1, 0.3, -1.5, 7, -7, 4.4$$

**Done partially. Useful, but not to consider for test:**

2. A signal can have two possible values, $s_0 = -3$ or $s_1 = 3$. The signal is affected
by gaussian noise with distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The receiver performs ML decision based on a single sample.
    a. What is the maximum variance $\sigma^2$ of the noise, such that
    the probability of wrongly detecting $s_1$ if the true signal is $s_0$
    is at most $10^{-3}$
    b. If the noise variance is $\sigma^2 = 0.5$, what is the minimum gap 
    between the two signal levels ($s_1 - s_0$) such that the probability of correct detection if the true signal is $s_1$
    is at least 0.9999?
