1. Let $A$ be a continuous r.v. with distribution $\mathcal{U} \; [0, \pi]$
    a. Draw the PDF of A
    a. Compute the probability that $A > 1$
    a. Compute the probability that $A \in (0,2)$
    a. Draw the CDF function and write its mathematical expression
    a. What is the distribution of $B = A-2$?

2. Let $A$ be a r.v. with distribution $\mathcal{N} \; \left(\mu=1, \sigma^2=2\right)$. 
    a. Compute the probability that $A \in [2, 4]$
    a. What is the distribution of $B = A-2$? 
    a. What is the maximum value of $w_A(x)$ and for what $x$ is it reached?
