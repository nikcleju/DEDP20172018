1. Let $A$ be a continuous r.v. with distribution $\mathcal{U} \; [0, \pi]$
    a. Draw the PDF of A
    a. Compute the probability that $A > 1$
    a. Compute the probability that $A \in (0,2)$
    a. Draw the CDF function and write its mathematical expression
    a. What is the distribution of $B = A-2$? 

2. Let $A$ be a r.v. with distribution $\mathcal{N} \; \left(\mu=1, \sigma^2=2\right)$. 
    a. Compute the probability that $A \in [2, 4]$
    a. What is the distribution of $B = A-2$? 
    a. What is the maximum value of $w_A(x)$ and for what $x$ is it reached?
    
3. Let $A$ be a **discrete** random variable with uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}\;[0,10]$
    a. How many different realizations of $A$ are possible?
    a. Draw the PMF of $A$
    a. Find the probability that A is an odd number
    a. Find the probability that $A \in [3, 7]$

3. Compute the probability that three r.v. $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(-1,1)$
are all positive simultaneously

4. Find the relation between the *erf()* function 
$$erf(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} dt$$
and the Laplace function
$$F(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}} dt$$
