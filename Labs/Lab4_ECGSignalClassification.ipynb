    "# ECG Signal Classification with the k-NN Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement and use the k-NN algorithm for classification of various signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "## ML decision with multiple samples in Gaussian noise\n",
    "\n",
    "In a detection problem with Gaussian noise, we have seen in the lectures that\n",
    "decision with the Maximum Likelihood criterion comes down to **choosing the smallest distance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\newcommand{\\grtlessH}{\\underset{{H_0}}{\\overset{H_{1}}{\\gtrless}}}$$\n",
    "$$ | r(t_0) - s_0(t_0) | \\grtlessH | r(t_0) - s_1(t_0) |$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when we have **multiple samples**? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have vectors of samples: $\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{s_0}, \\mathbf{s_1}$ (bold font = it is a vector)\n",
    "2. The distance between any two vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the **Euclidean distance**:\n",
    "   $$d(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}) = \\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2 + ... (a_n - b_n)^2}$$\n",
    "3. We use the same distance-based rule:\n",
    "  $$ d(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{s_0}) \\grtlessH d(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{s_1})$$\n",
    "  The smallest distance wins.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## The k-NN algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a set of **training signals** whose classes are known beforehand.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 100 signals of class A (e.g. ECG heart signals from healthy persons)\n",
    "- 100 signals of class B (e.g. ECG heart signals from ill persons)\n",
    "- maybe more classes\n",
    "    \n",
    "We have a new signal X. We need to decide to which class it belongs (class A, or class B, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use **the k-NN algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the distances from X to all the signals in the training set\n",
    "2. Choose the **closest $k$ neighbors**, take the class of the majority of them\n",
    "(e.g. majority voting). Decide that this is the class of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A visual illustration is below:\n",

    "(image from \"KNN Classification using Scikit-learn\", Avinash Navlani, https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/k-nearest-neighbor-classification-scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets organization\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we have at our disposal a large class of signals whose classes are known.\n",
    "The data is randomly split into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **training set**: this data is used for the majority voting\n",
    "- a **test set**: used only for **evaluation** of the algorithm performance.\n",
    "This data should never be used for training (the algorithm should never\n",
    "have seen this data before the testing).\n",
    "- (optional) a **cross-validation set**: a subset of the training set, \n",
    "used to determine which values of $k$ work best\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are obtained by randomly splitting all the signals available at the beginning.\n",
    "Common sizes of the datasets should be around $70\\%$ for the training set, $15\\%$ for the cross-validation set,\n",
    "$15\\%$ for the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data for this laboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory we will use ECG signal data from the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/).\n",

    "The excerpt provided for this lab contains electrocardiographic (ECG) signals from **4 classes**, with **120 signals per class**.\n",
    "The 4 classes are:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. 1 class with ECG from healthy persons\n",
    " 2. 3 classes with 3 different types of arrhythmia (irregular/abnormal heart beat)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECG signals provided here are preprocessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- all signals are segmented in **segments** corresponding to **one heart beat**\n",
    "- the signals are resized to **fixed length** 256 samples\n",
    "- the signals are resized so that the peak R wave is located at the center of the signal\n",
    "- the continuous component of all signals has been removed\n",
    "- the signals have been normalized to norm equal to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The signals are randomly split into two sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- training set: `ECG_train.mat`, 400 signals = 4 classes $\\times$ 100 signals each\n",

    "# Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the data files `'ECG_train.mat` and `'ECG_test.mat`. Explore the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - display 3 signals from each class contained in the training set. Try to figure out some visual differences.\n",
    "    - display the first signal from the test dataset. Try to determine visually to what class it belongs to.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Implement a function ``[class] = myKNN(signal, k, trainset)`` for performing k-NN classification of a signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the function takes as input an unclassified signal `signal`, the parameter value `k`, and the training set matrix `trainset`\n",
    "    - the function computes the Euclidean distance between `signal` and each vector from the training set\n",
    "    - the output `class` is defined by the majority of the $k$ nearest neighbours of the signal\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Call the function ``myKNN`` for each signal from the testing set and compare the classification results against the ground truth.\n",
    "   Use different values for $k$: $k=1$, then $k=5$, then $k=15$.\n",
    "   Compute the **confusion matrix** A, where $A_{ij}$ = how many signals of class $i$ are classified by our algorithm as being in class $j$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Repeat exercise 3, this time adding a variable amount of gaussian noise to the test signals.\n",
    "   How does the performance change?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat exercise 4., this time adding a DC component to the test signals. \n",
    "   How does the performance change?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the confusion matrix look like in the ideal case?\n",
    "(perfect classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is there a problem in case the classes are imbalanced? (different number of signals for the classes)\n"
