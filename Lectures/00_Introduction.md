### Evaluation

- Exam = 60%
    - 60% of final grade
    - Exercises and Theory
    - Similar to Information Theory exam
    
- Applications = 40%
    - Laboratory = 20%
        - in Matlab / Simulink
        - activity throughout semester (10%)
        - final laboratory practical test in Matlab / Simulink (10%)

    - Seminar + Intermediate tests = 20%
        - 3 tests: in Week 5, Week 8 and Week 11
        - test = one exercise, 30 minutes, during seminar
